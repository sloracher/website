I help multidisciplinary teams work as one.
When specialists talk past each other, priorities blur, decisions stall, and goals drift.
With an RF engineering background and a systems view, I translate across disciplines so expertise becomes shared understanding.
My focus is clarity: clear priorities, clear ownership, clear paths to delivery.
This page outlines how I work and where I add value.

  <summary><strong>Where I add value</strong></summary>

- Translate between engineering, product, and leadership so decisions are made on shared facts.
- Turn competing priorities into a single, visible plan with clear owners and checkpoints.
- Surface assumptions early; remove ambiguity in requirements, interfaces, and timelines.
- Keep momentum: short feedback loops, crisp reviews, and visible risk management.

- Reduced cross-team review cycles by **40%** by standardizing decision briefs and hand-offs.
- Unblocked a stalled RF/firmware integration in **3 weeks** by reframing requirements and creating a joint test plan.
- Delivered a multi-disciplinary prototype **on time** by aligning milestones across three vendors and two internal teams.
