I help multidisciplinary teams work as one.

When specialists talk past each other, priorities blur, decisions stall, and goals drift.

With an RF engineering background and a systems view, I translate across disciplines so expertise becomes shared understanding.

My focus is clarity: clear priorities, clear ownership, clear paths to delivery.

This page outlines how I work and where I add value.
